## The Research and It’s Application
**Object detection from the video taken by drone via Convolutional neural network**

<div style="text-align:justify"> The aim of this research is to show the implementation of object detection on drone videos using TensorFlow object detection API. The functional problem of the research is the identiﬁcation of people, trees, cars and buildings from the real-world video frames taken by drones. In the research explored how state-of-the-art object detection algorithms perform on image data from a drone. </div>

## Courseworks:

**Data Mining Course project :King-Rook versus King Chess Endgame Database.**

 <div style="text-align:justify"> Basing our analysis on interesting works using KRK patterns, we have developed a knowledge consisting in 16 attributes. Thus we were able to transform the primary database in a bunch of new ones by using different attribute sets. Thanks to Data Mining decision trees, we could then save the new databases very optimally, obtaining in the best case a compression 3 times better than standard compression methods.</div>
