[How to Win Friends and Influence People](../books/howtowinfriends.epub)
<div style="text-align: justify">
How to Win Friends and Influence People presents great and timeless social advice. It’s based on sound psychology and even if you’re an advanced student of the social arts, it’s still a great refresher.Also great is that Carnegie uses the many real-life examples to back his principles.

[Alchemist](../books/alchemist.epub)
<div style="text-align: justify">
The Alchemist is written by Paulo Coelho. It’s about a shepherd named Santiago following his dream or personal legend as it is described in the book. The shepherd starts the journey with a dream about finding treasure in the Pyramids of Egypt. He goes to a gypsy woman and an old man claiming to be a mysterious king and they both advise him to pursue it. The quotes that stuck out to me in the first chapters were: “To realize one’s destiny is a person’s only obligation”, and “When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”

[Mind Power](../books/Mind_Power.pdf)

Mind Power Into The 21st Century is a highly interesting read and we need to say that it is very well written. It actually includes anecdotes from Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Spitz and Carol Burnett. They are used to add that lively touch that such books need and they obviously add value to the lessons offered.
We can say that the book does take a really practical approach. The reader receives access to a set of techniques that can actually be applied on a day-to-day basis. Contrary to what many believe, this is quite refreshing since most self help books just highlight theories, without actually helping in applying them. John Kehoe does go the extra mile and uses a really easy to understand and straightforward approach. You will particularly love the lack of jargon and how easy it is to read.
