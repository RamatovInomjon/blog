[How to Win Friends and Influence People](../books/howtowinfriends.epub)
<div style="text-align: justify">
How to Win Friends and Influence People presents great and timeless social advice. It’s based on sound psychology and even if you’re an advanced student of the social arts, it’s still a great refresher.Also great is that Carnegie uses the many real-life examples to back his principles.

[Alchemist](../books/alchemist.epub)
<div style="text-align: justify">
The Alchemist is written by Paulo Coelho. It’s about a shepherd named Santiago following his dream or personal legend as it is described in the book. The shepherd starts the journey with a dream about finding treasure in the Pyramids of Egypt. He goes to a gypsy woman and an old man claiming to be a mysterious king and they both advise him to pursue it. The quotes that stuck out to me in the first chapters were: “To realize one’s destiny is a person’s only obligation”, and “When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”
