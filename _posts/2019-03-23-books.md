[How to Win Friends and Influence People](../books/howtowinfriends.epub)
<div style="text-align: justify">
How to Win Friends and Influence People presents great and timeless social advice. It’s based on sound psychology and even if you’re an advanced student of the social arts, it’s still a great refresher.Also great is that Carnegie uses the many real-life examples to back his principles.

[Alchemist](../books/alchemist.epub)
<div style="text-align: justify">
The Alchemist is written by Paulo Coelho. It’s about a shepherd named Santiago following his dream or personal legend as it is described in the book. The shepherd starts the journey with a dream about finding treasure in the Pyramids of Egypt. He goes to a gypsy woman and an old man claiming to be a mysterious king and they both advise him to pursue it. The quotes that stuck out to me in the first chapters were: “To realize one’s destiny is a person’s only obligation”, and “When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”

[Mind Power](../books/Mind_Power.pdf)
<div style="text-align: justify">
Mind Power Into The 21st Century is a highly interesting read and we need to say that it is very well written. It actually includes anecdotes from Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Spitz and Carol Burnett. They are used to add that lively touch that such books need and they obviously add value to the lessons offered.

[Money Master the Game](../books/money_master_thegame_7_simple.pdf)
<div style="text-align: justify">
Tony Robbins is a best-selling author and consummate showman. However, his financial advice is often solid. Offering a good introduction to financial planning, MONEY is worth the read, even though it does get bogged down with self-promotion and contradictory expert interviews.
