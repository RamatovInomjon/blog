# Amazing three years in China

<div style="text-align: justify">
Hi my friends, long time no see. By the way, this phrase (long time no see) come from Chinese to English, literally translation of "好久不见". I started with this, because our topic is about my amazing three years in China. Today, 2019 13th of July, I sent my friend and big brother Eshpulat back to Uzbekistan. We walked around the JiangHan Road, remembered our first days in China and I came up with idea writing all about for memory.
